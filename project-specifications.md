Flask Project Requirements is as follows -
The name of this project is ResourceMonitorKoro.
This has a backend, and a frontend dashboard. 
In the frontend, it will continuously show the all the resources metrics it collected from the system.
It will also show top 5 resource hungry processes all the time in the dashboard.

When the system uses 90% or above resources, it will generate an alert in the slack or whatsapp of the client.
When the system uses over 90% or above resources, 
   it will forcefully close some predefined processes if those are running.

The data collection can happen let's say every 1 minutes.
